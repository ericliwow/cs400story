A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, there was a physicist trying to open a safe. He knows that there is a cat inside the safe, and that cat has been in the safe for quite a long time-it could be dead by now.
The physicist wanted to know if the cat's dead or alive, so he kept trying different combinations of passwords on the safe. After an eon, he heard the safe make a "click" sound...

The physicist, was overwhelmed with joy, having waited countless years to rediscover what was inside. The physicist waited with bated breath as the safe door slowly swung open. But something strange was inside. Nothing. Nothing at all.
